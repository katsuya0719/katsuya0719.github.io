&lt;p&gt;One of my daily job is doing energy simulation for building. Using energy simulation, we can evaluate and imporve energy performance visualizing and investigating the result. However,it is not that easy to contribute to design. One of the reason is it takes time to go through energy simulation process. Thus, I think it is quite important to shorten the time for energy simulation process in order to contribute to better design decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eppy can automate post processing work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pythonhosted.org/eppy/"&gt;Eppy&lt;/a&gt; is python library for procesing data related to &lt;a href="https://energyplus.net/"&gt;EnergyPlus&lt;/a&gt;.
After doing energy simulation, energyplus produce lots of data as HTML file format.(Part of the example file is shown in below. This is just 1 page of total 107 pages!)&lt;br&gt;
Conventionally, we have been checking the result extracting parameters such as energy consumption, heat balance from this html file which was time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the function of eppy is parsing this html file. So once we specify the parameter we want to know, eppy extract that from the html file.Using this function, we can reduce post processing time and dig into the data more.
